# Hammer Time!!!
# :video_game: Game Programming Lab 2023 - House Rapture - Team4

Our game is a 2.5-dimensional, top-down game. The players find themselves on a playing field of limited size made up of square tiles. If a player walks across a tile, the tile will take damage. Do this often enough, and the tile breaks and disappears, leaving a gap in the field. If a player walks across such a gap or off the side of the field, they fall to their deaths. Players can throw hammers to knock each other back into unfavorable positions, and can manipulate both the traveling distance and the return path of the hammer. 

The result will be a game which feels slightly chaotic and surprising, but contains multiple strategic elements. Ideally, the game will also include items, of both chaotic and strategic nature, and obstacles which could block the travelling path of a hammer.

Members: Frederic Necker, Florian Buetler, Lasse Meinen, Deniz Yildiz, and Shiran Sun
