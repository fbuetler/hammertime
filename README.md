# Hammer Time!!!
# :video_game: Game Programming Lab 2023 - House Rapture - Team4

Our game is a 2.5-dimensional, top-down game. The players find themselves on a playing field of limited size made up of square tiles. If a player walks across a tile, the tile will take damage. Do this often enough, and the tile breaks and disappears, leaving a gap in the field. If a player walks across such a gap or off the side of the field, they fall to their deaths. 

Players can throw hammers to knock each other back into unfavorable positions and potentially push people off the map. You can charge your throw so that the hammer flies further away from you. Hammer come back to their owner once they reach maximum distance, be carfull not to be hit by a hammer you just dodged.

In case you are stuck in a little island of your making, or in case you really need to dodge a hammer, don't be afraid! You can always dash to cross gaps or evade. It is a risky move as you cannot move for a brief time after dashing but if you use it carefully it will be your key to victory!

To spice the game a bit, there are wall on the map that can't be crossed and will block hammers.
They are breakable however by throwing your hammer against them a few time

To win a round, one must be the last player to not have fallen in the arena (a draw is possible but is extraordinarly rare as two players must fall at the exact same frame)

The result is a game which feels slightly chaotic and surprising, but contains multiple strategic elements.
