Skrymir, the biggest and baddest of all frost giants, is sick and tired of
Thor's countless attempts at his life and has decided to play a little trick on
him. He has stolen Thor's hammer under the cover of the night and, as a master
of illusions, created countless copies of it! He handed out the copies to the
strongest humans he could find, giving one of them the real one. Thor,
kind-hearted god that he is, doesn't want to fight the humans. So he comes up
with the next-best alternative: he'll make the humans fight each other! Seeing
as there's no way a mere illusion could stand up to the original, he believes
that the last person standing must have Thor's beloved Mjoelnir. So, with the
promise of entry into Valhalla, the stage is set, and the warriors are off to
battle!
