Our game is a 2.5-dimensional, top-down game. The players find themselves on a playing field of limited size made up of square tiles. If a player walks across a tile, the tile will take damage. Do this often enough, and the tile breaks and disappears, leaving a gap in the field. If a player walks across such a gap or off the side of the field, they fall to their deaths. 

Players can throw hammers to knock each other back into unfavorable positions and potentially push people off the map. You can charge your throw so that the hammer flies further away from you, the longer you charge. The hammers come back to their owner once they reach maximum distance, be careful not to be hit by a hammer you just dodged.

In case you are stuck on a little island of your making, or in case you really need to dodge a hammer, don't be afraid! You can always dash to cross gaps or evade. It is a risky move as you cannot move for a brief time after dashing, but if you use it carefully it will be your key to victory!

To spice the game a bit, there are walls on the map that can't be crossed and will block hammers.
They are breakable however by throwing your hammer against them a few times.

To win a round, one must be the last player to not have fallen in the arena (a draw is possible but is extraordinary rare as two players must fall at the exact same time)

The result is a game which feels slightly chaotic and surprising, but contains multiple strategic elements.
